### Overview
# JRMS
### Joey's Record Management System
Record holdings management tool that aids in storage, retrieval and destruction of paper records. I want to use this as a chance to work with Grails. I chose this project idea because I use similar software at work. I belive the clarity of vision provided by that will make it easier to focus on learning Grails and React and desigining my project's functionality rather than having to make frequent changes to a plan that I don't have a clear vision for.  


### Features
1. CRUD through an ORM with 3 models
2. User accounts
3. Pagenation of db view
4. Unit testing and integration testing 


### Technologies
Grails
junit
mockito
Java 
Groovy 
mySQL
html
css

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to apply my experience from unit 3 to learn Grails and Groovy just as we did Spring and Java. I will also have to learn unit testing with junit and mockito. I'm excited to delve into those new(to me) technologies.
